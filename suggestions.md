Below are a set of recommendations to make your contrastive‐quality scores more discriminative. I’ve organized them into two parts: (1) higher‐level, “general” strategies you can adopt in your experimental design and (2) more “technical” tweaks you can apply directly in code or model setup.

---

## 1. General Improvements

1. **Enrich your prompt set**

   * **Multiple paraphrases**: For each “good” and “failure” concept, write several semantically equivalent prompts (e.g. “a fork with three distinct tines,” “a fork showing clear separation between prongs,” etc.). Averaging CLIP scores over all paraphrases tends to reduce noise and sharpen the good-vs-failure gap.
   * **Few‐shot context**: Instead of a single sentence, include one or two in‐context examples in your text prompt (e.g. “Example: a clear, three‐pronged fork. Now: \_\_”). CLIP can then leverage those exemplars to calibrate expectation.

2. **Expand your failure modes**

   * Right now each class has only one “failure” prompt. Real-world AI failures may be varied (e.g. missing prongs, extra prongs, wrong handle shape). Enumerate specific sub‐failure patterns and treat them as distinct “negative” prompts. This both covers more edge‐cases and prevents all failure semantics from collapsing into one rough cluster.

3. **Data‐driven threshold selection**

   * Rather than using a fixed 0.65/0.35 threshold across all classes, tune per‐class thresholds on a held‐out validation set. You might find that “knife” objects need a higher good‐score cutoff than “napkin” to be reliable.

4. **Post‐hoc calibration**

   * After scoring, fit a simple logistic regression (or isotonic regression) on your validation split that maps raw contrastive logits or softmax probabilities to well‐calibrated quality scores. This turns your raw similarity differences into a more monotonic, spread‐out quality metric.

5. **Evaluation and visualization**

   * Plot histograms or kernel‐density estimates of your good‐vs‐failure scores per class on both positive and negative examples. Visual inspection will tell you exactly how much overlap remains.
   * Compute ROC curves (TP vs FP rate) by sweeping thresholds; choose the operating point that maximizes, say, Youden’s J statistic (sensitivity + specificity – 1).

## 2. Technical Tweaks

1. **Use margin or difference scoring**

   ```python
   # Instead of softmax probability, score = good_sim − failure_sim
   margin_score = good_sim - failure_sim
   ```

   A raw margin often has a wider dynamic range than the 0–1 softmax output, making “high” vs “low” more separable.

2. **Temperature scaling**

   ```python
   temperature = 0.01  # try values in [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
   sims = similarities / temperature
   quality_prob = torch.softmax(sims, dim=-1)[0].item()
   ```

   Lower temperatures amplify differences; tuning this hyperparameter can stretch out your quality distribution.

3. **Ensemble over backbones**

   * Run the same contrastive check with both `ViT-B/32` and a higher‐capacity model (e.g. `ViT-L/14`), then average the scores. The ensemble often reduces variance.

4. **Train a lightweight probe**

   * Freeze CLIP’s encoders and train a small linear classifier (or 1–2‐layer MLP) on your prompt embeddings vs. image embeddings. Even a bit of fine‐tuning on a few labeled “good” vs “failure” crops can dramatically boost separability.

5. **Hard‐negative mining**

   * During evaluation, identify the most confusing failure prompts (those with highest failure\_sim on true good examples) and either drop them or refine their wording. Likewise, for any prompt that yields overly high good\_sim on real failures, rephrase or split it.

6. **Augmentation at inference**

   * Randomly perturb the crop (small rotations, color jitter) and average the resulting CLIP scores. This reduces sensitivity to bounding‐box misalignment and gives you a more robust estimate of quality.

By combining these strategies you should see a wider spread in your “quality\_score” distribution—medium‐scores will thin out, and truly high‐ or low‐quality cases will pull away from 0.5. Start by enriching your prompt set and plotting score histograms, then layer in the temperature‐and‐margin tweaks and, if necessary, a small logistic‐regression calibration or probe. Good luck with your experiments!
