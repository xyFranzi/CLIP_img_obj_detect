# CLIP Image Object Detection

This project implements OpenAI's CLIP model for targeted object detection and evaluation in images, including scripts and tools for processing images and bounding boxes, and evaluating object detection results.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect objects in images using CLIP.
- **Image Cropping**: Process and crop regions of interest from images.
- **Evaluation and Verification**
